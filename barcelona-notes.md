An interesting route for one of the days could be:

- Visit **Sagrada Familia** , or just walk around it. The ticket is around 20€From Sagrada Familia, I&#39;d go walking Calle Sant Antoni Maria Claret towards the city center, until **barrio de Gràcia.**
- I&#39;d walk around in barrio de Gràcia, getting lost in the historic narrow streets (like Carrer Verdi), visiting the squares (like Plaça de la Vila, Plaça de la Virreina).
- From Gràcia, I&#39;d go down **Paseo de Gràcia** , with the posh shopping stores.
- In Paseo de Gràcia you&#39;ll find   **La Pedrera and Casa Batlló** , both designed by Gaudí. It could be worth paying the ticket to visit them from the inside.
- I&#39;d keep going down Paseo de Gràcia to arrive at **Plaça Catalunya.**
- From there, I&#39;d go East down **Las Ramblas** until reaching **Mercat de la Boquería.** I&#39;d visit the market and the different stands with all kind of foods.
- From the market, **I**&#39;d go to the Barrio Gótico **,** where the **Cathedral** On the way there, I&#39;d make sure I went through **the Plaça Reial**.
- **Barrio Gótico** is a beautiful quarter of the city. Worth spending some time walking around.

Another interesting route could be:

- Start **in Parc de la Ciutadella** , and after visiting it, walk until   **Arc del Triomf** which is a massive construction.
- From there, I&#39;d get into   **El Born** , an interesting quarter of the city. There you&#39;ll find an impressive church, **Santa María del Mar.**
- Going from El Born to **Barceloneta** is a short and easy walk. While in **Barceloneta,** I&#39;d enjoy the beach :)

Here&#39;s a list of other interesting places:

- Hospital de Sant Pau, a former hospital with very cool architecture.
- Plaça d&#39;Espanya and Las Arenas shopping center (an old bullring repurposed as a shopping center)
- Parc Güell, with very cool views of the city
- Montjuic Castle, with nice views of the city too
- Tibidabo, a bit far from the city, but with amazing views
- Parc Laberint d&#39;Horta, a garden in the shape of a maze
- Sant Antoni and Poble Nou quarters. Nothing really special about them, but with plenty of bars to have something to eat and drink
- Sitges, a nearby town with a nice beach
- Montserrat, a bit far but with a cool monastery in the middle of a mountain. Great if you&#39;re in for some mild hiking. Excellent views from the top (around 1.5h walk).
